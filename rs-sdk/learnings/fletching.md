# Fletching

## Getting Started (Level 1)

### Knife Location
- Spawns at **(3224, 3202)** - SE of Lumbridge castle
- May need to wait for respawn (2s intervals)

### Training Method
1. Pick up knife from ground spawn
2. Chop logs from nearby trees (~3200, 3230)
3. Use knife on logs → arrow shafts (15 per log)
4. Only need ~4 logs to reach level 10+ (bonus XP)

## Notes
- Arrow shafts give ~375 XP per log (with bonus XP)
- Shortbows can be made at level 5.
